Fit4Win is an app developed to facilitate efficient documentation and conveyance of information between the patient and the doctor.  

The welcome screen displays the login and registration options for patients. If a doctor wishes to access the patient information he/she can click on the 'Are you a Doctor?' option.

* My Doctors: List of all the doctors that we have added to as 'My Doctor'.
* Allergies: List of all the allergies that we have added, along with an option to add new ones.
